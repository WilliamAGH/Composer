// Chat UI page for ComposerAI
// We can have index.html forward to this
// We can later have email-backend.html next have a flow to "seed" a new chat with the uploaded email context, and then
a follow-up prompt to the user saying I have this email, what would you like to know about it or do next with it?
// This should use the layout.html template for consistent styling, which relies upon app-shared.css and Tailwind CSS
// We can add a side panel for the conversation history that also uses app-shared.css/Tailwind
